# blockchain-learning-kit
Learning kit for learning all that you need to know about the blockchain before the JSHacks Hackathon.


## Motivation

Resources on blockchain are starting to appear everywhere. A lot of people are writing about the part of the topic they are learning about.

Some people are writing amazing articles, that help spread the knowledge. But it's all scattered across the internet and it's quite hard to put the pieces together. Some articles have unmentioned prerequisite knowledge, some venture into far too much detail and technical terminology. But they all contribute to the growing understanding of blockchain technology.

So I am making a compilation which will introduce you gradually to the complexities of the blockchain, leveraging the amazing work that has already been done by people in their own effort to learn about the blockchain.


## Milestones - Should be completed in this order

- [x] Get a list of 20 articles from people that are currently learning about this. Classify then come back and look through references.
- [x] Read each, and provide in the list, a 1 sentence summary of what it is about.
- [x] Classify according to technical difficulty ( beginner, intermediate, advanced).
- [ ] Structure them in a logical order, so they follow logically one from the other. And fill the gaps in information with other articles.
- [ ] Make a presentation using resources from existing articles, putting everything together, starting simple and gradually introducing nuances and complexities of the blockchain.

## Resources

Each level of difficulty should have summary articles and detailed articles. Summaries come before the detailed ones, so one can see the big picture and fit it in his head.
Note to self, after a certain point more information becomes irrelevant to understanding and to the purpose of this kit.

Rules:
 - If an article requires prerequisite knowledge that is assumed in the text, then it should go after another article that has prerequisite knowledge.
 - We always start with general, high-level information, and after that further articles zoom in either on more specific issues, or explain things in more detail.

Labels:
  * on difficulty:
    * [BEGINNER] / [INTERMEDIATE] / [ADVANCED];
  * depth it covers an issue:
    * [DETAILED] / [SUMMARY]
  * subtopic of the blockchain that it focuses on:
    * e.g. [SMART-CONTRACTS][CRYPTOCURRENCY][ICO]
  * articles with this tag I might delete since I'm not sure they are relevant to the purpose of learning at this point 
    * [NOT-SURE]
  * developer resource 
    * [DEVELOPMENT]
