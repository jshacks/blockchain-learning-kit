# blockchain-learning-kit
Learning kit for learning all that you need to know about the blockchain before the JSHacks Hackathon.


## Motivation

Resources on blockchain are starting to appear everywhere. A lot of people are writing about the part of the topic they are learning about.
Some people are writing amazing articles, that help spread the knowledge. But it's all scattered across the internet and it's quite hard to put the pieces together.
Even the existing knowledgebases are struggling with this.

So I am making one which will introduce you gradually to the complexities of the blockchain, leveraging the amazing work that has already been done by amazing people on their own effort to learn about the blockchain.


## Milestones - Should be completed in this order

- [ ] Get a list of 20 articles from people that are currently learning about this. Classify then come back and look through references.
- [ ] Read each, and provide in the list, a 1 sentence summary of what it is about.
- [ ] Structure them in a logical order, so they follow logically one from the other.
- [ ] Classify according to technical difficulty ( beginner, intermediate, advanced). Meaning you should read the beginner ones, to understand the big picture, before diving into the details.
- [ ] Make a presentation using resources from existing articles, putting everything together, starting simple and gradually introducing nuances and complexities of the blockchain.

## Resources

Each level of difficulty should have summary articles and detailed articles. Summaries come before the detailed ones, so one can see the big picture and fit it in his head.
Note to self, after a certain point more information becomes irrelevant to understanding and to the purpose of this kit.

Rules:
 - If an article requires prerequisite knowledge that is assumed in the text, then it should go after another article that has prerequisite knowledge.

Labels:
  - beginner/intermediate/advanced;
  - detailed or summary;
  - subtopic of the blockchain that it focuses on (e.g. smart contracts)
  - articles with this tag I might delete since I'm not sure they are relevant to the purpose of learning at this point - [NOT-SURE]
  - developer resource - [DEVELOPMENT]
  - for a list of subtopics we might need to address, look into this article - https://hackernoon.com/a-primer-on-blockchains-protocols-and-token-sales-9ebe117b5759
